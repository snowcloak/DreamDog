DreamDog

There are so many different kinds(/breeds) of dogs that it can become tough and daunting choosing the ‘right kind of’ dog that fits you.
Dream dog makes the process alot easier for you. 
The goal of “Dream Dog” is to find the perfect dog breed for the user based on the user’s preferences. 
The user would also get to interact with other users on the site that have their ‘dream’ dog by sending a ‘bark.’
